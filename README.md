# LazyDrop Server

LazyDrop is a real-time file sharing and collaboration platform.  
This repository contains the backend server built with Spring Boot, providing RESTful APIs and WebSocket support for session management, file orchestration, billing, and real-time notifications.

---

## 🚀 Overview

The LazyDrop Server acts as the central backend service responsible for:

- Managing **Drop Sessions** (temporary or persistent collaboration rooms)
- Secure **File Orchestration** using signed URLs via Supabase Storage
- Real-time collaboration using WebSockets (STOMP)
- Subscription & billing management via Stripe
- Identity resolution and security enforcement via Supabase JWT validation
- Plan enforcement and operational safeguards

The backend is designed with reliability, idempotency, and security in mind.

---

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

LazyDrop follows a layered backend architecture:

Client (Web / Mobile)
↓
REST Controllers
↓
Service Layer (Business Logic)
↓
Repository Layer (JPA/Hibernate)
↓
PostgreSQL


Real-time communication is handled via STOMP WebSockets.

### External Integrations

- Supabase (Auth + Storage)
- Stripe (Billing & Webhooks)

The system enforces clear separation of concerns:

- Controllers → Request/response handling  
- Services → Business logic & validation  
- Repositories → Data access  
- Modules → Domain-driven boundaries

2️⃣ Configure Environment Variables
Create a .env file or configure environment variables:

Variable	Description
DB_URL	PostgreSQL connection URL
DB_USER	Database username
DB_PASSWORD	Database password
SUPABASE_URL	Supabase project URL
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY	Supabase public key
SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET	JWT secret for validation
SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY	Service role key
SUPABASE_BUCKET_NAME	Storage bucket name

3️⃣ Build Application
./mvnw clean install
4️⃣ Run Application
./mvnw spring-boot:run
Server starts at:

http://localhost:8080/api/v1
🧪 Testing Strategy
LazyDrop follows a layered testing approach:

Unit Testing
Service-layer logic tested using JUnit

Mockito used for dependency mocking

Plan limits, permission checks, and validation logic explicitly tested

Controller Testing
MockMvc used for endpoint validation

Tests verify HTTP status codes and response contracts

Edge Case Testing
Plan limit enforcement

Unauthorized access attempts

Expired / malformed JWTs

Duplicate join or confirm attempts (idempotency validation)

Tests run automatically during CI builds to prevent regressions.

Future Enhancements
Testcontainers for integration testing

Coverage reporting badge

Load testing for high-participant sessions

🛡️ Reliability & Idempotency
Two-Step File Upload Protection
The upload process uses:

Signed URL generation

Metadata confirmation

To prevent orphaned files:

Confirm endpoint is idempotent

Background cleanup job removes unconfirmed uploads

Idempotent Operations
Endpoints like /confirm and /join are designed to:

Handle retries safely

Avoid duplicate participant creation

Return consistent responses

📊 Observability & Logging
Structured logging via SLF4J

Centralized exception handling using global exception handlers

Security-sensitive fields (JWTs, secrets) are never logged

Plan limit violations logged at WARN level

Stripe webhooks verified before processing

Future Improvements
Correlation IDs for request tracing

Metrics export via Micrometer

Health checks and readiness probes
